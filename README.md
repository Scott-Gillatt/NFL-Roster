# NFL-Roster
NFL Roster Program

AnggularJS App that performs  $HTTP Get that will then return a promise of data.  Created a spinner to show that a call is currently being excuted.  Once the data is returned, user is able to set players to load the players onto the screen.

Simple mock NFL app that allows you to select users from a list of NFL players that is returned from the $HTTP Get.  To help create the desired fantasy team.

Created filter system that allows user to filter own roster or NFL roster based on Team, Position, or both.

Allow user to change the filter of how many players can been seen at one time with a input that then changes the filter in the code of how many are shown by default.

Used a Toggled Menu feature found online to help hide some search boxs from the users view if they don't want that shown all the time.
